In ionic bonds, the metal loses electrons to become a positively charged cation, whereas the nonmetal accepts those electrons to become a negatively charged anion.","tags":"Chemistry, Bonds","tokens":["Ionic bonding","complete transfer","valence electron","atoms","It","type","chemical bond","two oppositely charged ions","ionic bonds","metal","electrons","positively charged cation","nonmetal","negatively charged anion"]},"98e966a4-0e06-4e50-b85b-3e6eebf51fb3":{"author":"Sol Foster","tokens":["A covalent bond","molecular bond","chemical bond","","sharing","electron pairs","atoms","These electron pairs","shared pairs bonding pairs","stable balance","attractive repulsive forces","electrons","covalent bonding"],"subject":"Covalent Bonding","body":"A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.
